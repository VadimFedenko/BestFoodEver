# Control the Algorithm

**1. Sliders (0–10):** Set your priorities.
*Cost = 10* → The app rates **cheap** dishes higher.
*Cost = 0* → Disables the priority.

**2. Tap a priority:** Inverts it.
*Cheap* → *Expensive*.
Then the **more expensive** a dish is, the **higher** it scores.

**3. Economic zones:** Change the region → the cost is recalculated using local prices.

**4. Presets:** The *Save* button stores your top list. Presets are saved locally on your device.

<summary><strong>Why $/1000kcal?</strong></summary>

The app offers 3 price metrics: `$/kg`, `$/serving`, and `$/1000kcal`. Why all three?

Comparing two dishes by price per serving is hard (serving sizes vary).

Comparing per kg isn’t always practical either. Imagine: a liter of tea costs almost nothing — and it can be tasty and fast. Per kg, tea would be the best “dish” in the world. The only downside is that it has ~0 calories.

That’s why it’s often useful to look at prices per calorie.
Hence the three different metrics in the app (and no tea at all here!).
