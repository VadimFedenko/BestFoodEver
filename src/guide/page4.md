# That’s it!
Even if I were the only person on the planet, I’d still build this app (in between crying into a pillow because of an existential crisis).
But the real goal is to inspire you to make culinary masterpieces: cooking tasty, fast, healthy, and cheap is actually simple.
I hope this app helps you the same way it helps me.

*   **Free, open source**
*   **Offline, no accounts**
*   **No tracking** *(How the hell am I supposed to know how many users the service has?)*
*   **Local data only**
*   **PWA**

<details> <summary><strong>Some plans</strong></summary>

*   *New dishes. Why don’t we have gyudon? We need gyudon.*
*   *New optional priorities: FODMAP index, pH calculation.*
*   *We need more data*
*   *Ingredient closeness graph for optimization and dish similarity.*
*   *Computing the balance of taste modalities in dishes from their ingredients*
