# Hello there, I’m Vadim
I’m honestly terrible at the whole food thing: I want to eat healthy, but I don’t have the money.
I want to cook something delicious, but it takes the whole evening. I want it faster — and it turns unhealthy. It feels like you can’t have it all at once.

But here's an idea: What if you took every dish in the world and rated it on a 10-point scale:

* <span data-icon="taste"></span> **Taste**
* <span data-icon="health"></span> **Health**
* <span data-icon="speed"></span> **Speed**
* <span data-icon="cost"></span> **Cost**

Then you just average the scores. Which dishes end up on top?

If you take the healthiest dishes from cafés and restaurants, they’ll be closer to the top — because restaurants optimize the other three parameters *(time, cost, taste)*. Seven years ago, that was my first insight.
All that was left was to pick the dishes I actually liked and calculate their ranking.

That’s how an entire world of omelets, weird salads, and soups opened up for me. Without noticing, I started eating very well, and didn't spend a ton of time or money.

But I kept rating dishes “in my head”. until I realized what I had to do.
After psyching myself up, I ran an analysis on a big pile of data: social media sentiment, summaries of scientific papers, recipe parsing, economic databases, and so on.

That’s how Foood.top was born — a personal dish ranking with automatic re-ranking based on your priorities.
